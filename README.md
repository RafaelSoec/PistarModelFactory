# PistarModelFactory 


 Pistar is an open-source goal modelling tool. Its key distinguishing characteristics are:
  - it runs entirely on the browser, thus no installation needed
  - high visual fidelity (we want your diagrams to be pretty, even when printed)
  - supports the [iStar 2.0 standard](https://sites.google.com/site/istarlanguage/)


Pistar Model Factory uses the Pistar modeling tool and combines objective modeling with software product line techniques.

## Enviromment Configuration File

The environment configuration file is a json file that has fundamental attributes to ensure that different functionalities can be activated from the model generated by Pistar.

The configuration file structure is constructed by the following attributes: environment, buttons and properties.
{
   "enviromment": String,
   "buttons": Array<Buttons>
   "properties": Array<Properties>
 }

### Enviromment

The attribute environment defines the name of the environment that will be loaded.
